    "**Managing multiple logins**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson, we showed how a client might create an authenticated identity with a server, and use tokens to validate additional service requests.  The server `project.py` is very similar to the one shown in the lesson.  It varies only in adding a few additional authorized users and in personalizing the response so that each user receives something identifiably distinct from the `/get-info` route.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `project.py` server runs on port 5014, and uses the same `pubkey.pem` and `private.pem` used in the lesson itself for TLS encryption of the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you wish to have a client (or other micro-service) that manages multiple collections of credentials to make requests specific to varying users.  Write code to login as each of \"Diane\" and \"Eshana\" once, and make requests to the `/get-info` route as each of them several times without requiring a new login.  Feel free examine the code of `project.py`, as well as launching it by running it at a terminal."

After that, a new login will be required for use of the service.\n",
