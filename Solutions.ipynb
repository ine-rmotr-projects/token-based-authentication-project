    "In the lesson, we showed how a client might create an authenticated identity with a server, and use tokens to validate additional service requests.  The server `project.py` is very similar to the one shown in the lesson.  It varies only in adding a few additional authorized users and in personalizing the response so that each user receives something identifiably distinct from the `/get-info` route.\n",

    "For this task, you wish to have a client (or other micro-service) that manages multiple collections of credentials to make requests specific to varying users.  Write code to login as each of \"Diane\" and \"Eshana\" once, and make requests to the `/get-info` route as each of them several times without requiring a new login.  Feel free examine the code of `project.py`, as well as launching it by running it at a terminal."
